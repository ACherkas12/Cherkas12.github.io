            <li>
            <strong>One more reason</strong> - We are <strong>not toxic</strong>. Ultimate is the most kind sport in the world. It is so because we have the <strong>oficial spirit rules</strong>.

            <p>
            There is a special moment that I remember for a long time. It happened during the World Cup in the USA. It was a late afternoon, when the sun was approaching the horizon, Pavel Budnik and I were returning to the tent tired after the games. Food was distributed under it, the players ate and communicated with each other. At that time, a game was being played on a nearby field.

            I was impressed by the game of mixed teams by the fact that players enjoyed every second on the field. They were happy and smiling, supporting each other and rivals as if it was a friendly match of the best friends. At the same time, the game was super intense and tense until the last minutes. I couldn't believe it was already evening, and the players had so much energy that they could charge the whole tent with it instead of delicious food.
            
            "It seems that this is the real Ultimate," - I shared with Pavel.
